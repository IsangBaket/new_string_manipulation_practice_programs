# Prog04. isupper() check if all characters of the string is on upper case. 
# Create a program that do the same functionality without using isupper() function.


# this is still a pseudocode I still need to d
ask user input 

for char in user input # iterate over every character 
    if all characters in user input is in uppercase
        print True

    else 
        print False
